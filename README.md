## Concepts

Below are a quick explanation of the terms you'll need to understand to set up
this integration.

### Events

**Events** are units of time as tracked by ActivityWatch, e.g. time spent in the
"Firefox" app with some window title.

### Categories

**Categories** are simply the categories you can define in ActivityWatch for
classifying time.  For example, by default, ActivityWatch comes with things like
`["Work","Programming"]` for the regex
`GitHub|Stack Overflow|BitBucket|Gitlab|vim|Spyder|kate|Ghidra|Scite`.
You can define more, edit, or delete them in your ActivityWatch settings
interface, which is probably located [here](http://localhost:5600/#/settings)
(unless you're running on a non-standard port).  ActivityWatch uses these
**Categories** to categorize **Events**.

### Measures

**Measures** are simply `Time Entry` measures on Conjure.

### Links

**Links** are the only "new" concept in this integration.  A link is simply one
or more **Categories** in ActivityWatch and a single **Measure** on Conjure.
This integration will then automatically upload **Events** that match those
categories to that measure on Conjure.

## Initial Setup and Configuration

Note that the `aw-conjure-integration` config folder should be located here:

* Linux: `~/.config/aw-conjure-integration` (or
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aw-conjure-integration`)
* macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/aw-conjure-integration`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\aw-conjure-integration\Config`

1. Create `settings.json` in the aforementioned config folder and define your
   settings.
   1. You can do this manually, by copying over and editing
      [./config-example/settings.json](./config-example/settings.json), or using
      the Dhall configuration language as with the example at
      [./config-example/settings.dhall](./config-example/settings.dhall) and
      running `dhall-to-json`.  If you don't know what Dhall is, don't worry
      about it, just use the aforementioned JSON file.
   2. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on Conjure
      [here](https://conjure.so/settings/api).  You can name it "ActivityWatch
      Integration" or whatever you like (but something you'll remember is
      associated with this integration).  Replace the placeholder token in your
      `settings.json` with this token (or write it down for later use), as
      Conjure will only show it to you once.
2. Set up and export your categories from the ActivityWatch web interface. (The
   option should be [here](http://localhost:5600/#/settings), unless you're
   running on a non-standard port.)  Place the JSON file in the config folder.
   **This step will need to be repeated any time you change your categories.**
3. Create `links.json` in the config folder and define your links.
   1. Create any time measures on Conjure you'd like to link to ActivityWatch
   (if you haven't already).  New measures can be created
   [here](https://conjure.so/measures/new); note that they **must** be of type
   `Time Entry`.
   2. Now you'll need the ID's of the measures.  You can get them conveniently
      by running `aw-conjure-integration --list-measures`; this will print out a
      list of measures and their associated ID's (which look like this:
      `meas_A1pHanUM3r1c`).
   3. Create links as you desire.  You can do this manually, by copying over and
      editing [./config-example/links.json](./config-example/links.json), or
      using the Dhall configuration language as with the example at
      [./config-example/links.dhall](./config-example/links.dhall) and
      running `dhall-to-json`.  If you don't know what Dhall is, don't worry
      about it, just use the aforementioned JSON file.
   4. You can have as many links as you'd like and can freely add/delete more
      in the future by editing this file.
4. You're done!  Simply run the program now with `aw-conjure-integration`, and
   it will upload your time without further intervention on your part.  (You'll
   need to restart it if you close it or you restart your computer.)

## CLI

Note that settings provided via the CLI override any value found in the
`settings.json` file.  For example, you can leave your PAT out of
`settings.json` and instead just call `aw-conjure-integration -p <YOUR_PAT>`

### Other Functionality

* `--list-measures` -- List available measures from Conjure along with their IDs and exit

### Config File Paths

* `-c <path>` / `--categories <path>` -- Path to the categories file, overriding
  `aw-category-export.json` in the config folder (if it exists).
* `-s <path>` / `--settings <path>` -- Path to the settings file, overriding
  `settings.json` in the config folder (if it exists).
* `-l <path>` / `--links <path>` -- Path to the links file, overriding
  `links.json` in the config folder (if it exists).

### Settings

These can simply be provided in the settings file, but ones passed via the CLI
will override any found there.

* `-b <minutes>` / `--bin-size <minutes>` -- `aw-conjure-integration` works on
  the basis of periods of time, within which similar events are grouped
  together, to avoid creating thousands of entries on Conjure as you alt-tab
  between windows.  By default, this is **30 minutes**, but it may be changed in
  the range from 5â€“60 minutes, provided that the value evenly divides an hour.
  Decreasing the value produces finer resolution time tracking and more
  "responsive" time tracking at the expense of having more measurements on
  Conjure.  Note that no events are uploaded until at least 1 minute past the
  end of a period, e.g. if you use the default 30 minute periods, events will be
  uploaded at about 12:01, 12:31, 1:01, 1:31, etc., whereas with 10 minute
  periods, they would be uploaded at 12:01, 12:11, 12:21, 12:31, etc.
* `-g <Category|AppAndTitle>` / `--group-by <Category|AppAndTitle>` --
  * `Category` (default) -- Group events that share the same category together
    before uploading them to Conjure.  This protects your privacy (by ensuring
    app and title info is never sent to Conjure) and cuts down on the number of
    measurements per period created.
  * `AppAndTitle` -- Group together events that share the same app and title.
    This will upload this higher-resolution data to Conjure and puts such usage
    data into Conjure (which may be a privacy concern for you).
* `-p <PAT>` / `--pat <PAT>` -- Your Personal Access Token for the Conjure API.
  You can make a new one [here](https://conjure.so/settings/api).  No value is
  provided for this by default, as it is unique to each user.
* `-u` / `--report-unmatched` -- Whether or not (the default) to report events
  that do not match any links. These unmatched events will be logged at each
  upload cycle.  If you don't have many links set up, this is a good way to get
  ideas for new categories/links.

## Limitations

* Conjure measures have to be manually created on the
  [website](https://conjure.so/measures/new).  This isn't likely to change,
  since it isn't something that one has to do terribly often, and it doesn't
  seem it would be more convenient via this integration than in Conjure itself.
* Conjure measures have to be referenced by ID, not name.  This is to allow you
  to freely rename measures in Conjure without having to tweak the config of
  this integration and so is more of a feature.
* Categories have to be manually exported from ActivityWatch.  This is sadly a
  limitation of ActivityWatch itself, as they don't reside anywhere except
  nebulously in the web interface.  If they become accessible via another
  manner, this will definitely be changed.
* Currently, this integration only supports the `aw-watcher-window` (and
  `aw-watcher-afk`)
  [watchers](https://docs.activitywatch.net/en/latest/watchers.html).  If there
  is a desire for them, additional watchers could be added.
